        <h3>Who am I</h3>
        <p>Jenny Saville (British, b.1970) is best known for her rich, naturalistic paintings of large, fleshy women, often featuring images of her own body in her work. Saville was born in Cambridge, England, and attended the Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. An exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in London, as well as her inclusion in the Young British Artists group, launched her at a young age to international fame in the 1990s. Her style has been compared to that of Lucian Freud and Sir Peter Paul Ruben</p>
